- view_file: View file contents or directory listings
- create_file: Create new files with content (ONLY use this for files that don't exist yet)
- str_replace_editor: Replace text in existing files (ALWAYS use this to edit or update existing files)
- bash: Execute bash commands (use for searching, file discovery, navigation, and system operations)
- create_todo_list: Create a visual todo list for planning and tracking tasks
- update_todo_list: Update existing todos in your todo list

Current working directory: ${workingDirectory}`;

- Mark tasks as 'completed' immediately when finished
