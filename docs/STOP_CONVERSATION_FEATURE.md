# Stop Conversation Feature

## Overview
The KILOCODE CLI now includes a convenient way to stop ongoing conversations and operations by pressing the 's' key.

## Features Added

### 1. Stop Conversation with 's' Key
- **Functionality**: Press 's' during any processing operation to immediately stop it
- **Scope**: Works in both JurikoAgent and MultiLLMAgent modes
- **Feedback**: Shows a clear message when operation is stopped: "⏹️ Operation stopped by user (pressed 's')"

### 2. Enhanced Processing Animation
- **Visual Feedback**: Animated spinner with rotating frames
- **Dynamic Messages**: Cycling through different processing messages
- **Real-time Stats**: Shows processing time and token count
- **Clear Instructions**: Displays available keyboard shortcuts during processing

### 3. Updated User Instructions
- **Help Command**: Updated `/help` to include keyboard shortcuts
- **Interface Messages**: Added instructions in chat interface
- **Consistent Messaging**: All components show the same keyboard shortcuts

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action | Context |
|-----|--------|---------|
| `s` | Stop current operation | During processing |
| `ESC` | Cancel current operation | During processing |
| `Ctrl+C` | Exit application | Anytime |
| `Ctrl+P` | Switch provider/model | Anytime (StreamingChat) |

## Technical Implementation

### Components Modified
1. **Enhanced Loading Spinner** (`src/ui/components/enhanced-loading-spinner.tsx`)
   - New animated spinner component
   - Shows processing time, token count, and instructions
   - Cycling messages for better user experience

2. **Input Handlers** (`src/hooks/use-input-handler.ts`, `src/ui/components/streaming-chat.tsx`)
   - Added 's' key detection
   - Calls `agent.abortCurrentOperation()` when pressed
   - Adds stop message to chat history

3. **Chat Interface** (`src/ui/components/chat-interface.tsx`)
   - Updated to use enhanced loading spinner
   - Added instruction text about 's' key functionality

### Agent Integration
- Both `JurikoAgent` and `MultiLLMAgent` already had `abortCurrentOperation()` methods
- Uses `AbortController` to properly cancel ongoing operations
- Graceful handling of cancellation in streaming operations

## Usage Examples

1. **Start a long operation**: Ask KILOCODE to perform a complex task
2. **Stop the operation**: Press 's' while it's processing
3. **See confirmation**: The interface shows "⏹️ Operation stopped by user (pressed 's')"
4. **Continue normally**: You can immediately start a new conversation

## Benefits

- **Better User Control**: Users can stop unwanted or long-running operations
- **Improved UX**: Clear visual feedback and instructions
- **Consistent Behavior**: Works across all interface modes
- **Non-disruptive**: Stopping doesn't crash or exit the application
